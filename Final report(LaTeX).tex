\section*{Abstract}
This document is the final report summarizing the work done by me during my 6 week research internship at the Faculty of Bioinformatics led by Prof. Dominik Grimm at TUM Campus Straubing. Under the assistance of PhD Student Jonathan Pirnay I was introduced into the basic concepts of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Deep Q-Learning (DQL). After gainig knowdledge in this topics, i apllied it to solva a toy problem (\textit{Lunar Lander} Box2D environment) using \textit{Python} programming language. Using \textit{Gym} library, allowing usage of preexisting environments based of Atari 2600 games and other games used for testing DQN-Algorithms, I programmed my own an Deep Q-Algorithm. The main goal was to solve the environemnt of \textit{Lunar Lander}, i.e. achieving an average score of 200. This document summarizes what I have learned about both Reinforcement Learning and Deep Q-Learning, and describes their implementation with \textit{Python}.

\section*{Introduction}
CONTENT

\section*{Methods}
The main tool used to write the Deep Q-Algorithm was \textis{Python} with its libraries \textbf{PyTorch, Matplotlib, NumPy}, as well as functions \textit{deque()} and \textit{namedtuple()} from library \textbf{collections}

\section{Reinforcement Learning}
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a subset of Machine Learning (ML) which is concerned with usage of big datasets for training an AI agent.

RL assumes that every interaction between any agent and an environment can be modeled as maximisation of some kind of reward received by an agent due to interaction with its surroundings. The definition of the reward is ambiguous and its correct decription in code, which is at the hearth of RL reasearch, is the main task of programming using RL.

\subsection{Bellman equation and loss function}
Bellman equation describes the action-state function $Q^\pi$ based on the current state $s$ and possible actions $a$ to take at that state.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:bellman}
Q^\pi(s,a) = r+\gamma Q^\pi(s',\pi(s'))
\end{equation}
\\
Loss function $\mathcal{L}$ is a squared difference of Q-target and the current Q-value.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:loss}
\mathcal{L} = \alpha(r+\gamma\max Q(s',a')-Q(s,a))^2
\end{equation}

\section{Deep Q-Learning}
\subsection{Neural Networks - The \textit{Deep} of Q-Learning}
Deep Q-Learning combines the usage of action-state function $Q^\pi$ to describe the state, in which our agent resides, with neural networks processing the input data through a complicated network of layered neurons. At the end, the neural network outputs an "answer" to the current state.

\section{Gym Environment: Lunar Lander}
Until now we considered the technicalities and theory governing the algorithm of an agent. In this section we will go in depth into the implementation of DQN. This part of the research internship consisted of using previously gained theoretical knowdledge of the subject, aswell as online resources (such as tutorials and official documentation of libraries) and applying them in \textit{Python}. Here, using libraries \textit{PyTorch} and \textit{Gym} (as well as other smaller ones, such as e.g. Matplotlib, NumPy), I programmed an Deep Q-Algorithm that was able to interact with a online distributed Box2D environment  \textit{Lunar Lander} and solve it, i.e. achieve an average score of 200 in past 100 episodes.

\subsection{Description of the environment}
In the game of \textit{Lunar Lander} the task of the agent is to land a lunar lander onto an area in the middle of the screen (at coordinates $(0,0)$) in a given time without crashing the vehicle or leaving the bounds set by the environment. The environment is described with an vector with 8 variables (such as x position, y position, angle with respect to the ground, ...). Agent interacts with the environment through 4 actions; doing nothing or turning one of the three engines on (either left, right or bottom).

\subsection{Setting up the environoment}
Using command \textit{import gym} and env = gym.make("LunarLander-v2") the environment is imported into the IDE'\footnotemark \space workspace.
\footnotetext{IDE used was PyCharm Community Edition}

\subsubsection{Reward system}
Reward and the choices of the agent are based on the action-value function \ref{eqn:bellman}

\subsubsection{Defining the neural network \textit{class}}
The neural network was divided

\section*{Results and Discussion}
Agent was able to solved the environment in x episodes.

After the first iteration of the code was succesful in solving the environment, some of the parameters were changed during the subsequent runs. For every run the same statistics were noted and new behaviour of the agent observed.
